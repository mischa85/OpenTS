This is the earlier of the two reads of the assignment, made before the main window exists. Either dimension left out or written as `-1` replaces both with 640 by 480, so a width alone is never enough to size the screen. The main window is then created at the resulting size, and the game reports a video error and stops if the renderer cannot start.

The size also fixes the layout the game is drawn into: the sidebar takes 168 pixels of the width for each step of [`UIScale`](/keys/uiscale/), and the tactical view is given what is left.
