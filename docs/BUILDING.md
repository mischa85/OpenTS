# Building OpenTS

> [!IMPORTANT]
> OpenTS supports Visual Studio 2022 Win32 Debug and Release builds. Both were
> verified from a fresh CMake configuration. A successful build does not

## Supported target

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Host and architecture | Windows, 32-bit (`Win32`) target |
| Processor | SSE2, so a Pentium 4 or Athlon 64 onward |
| Generator and compiler | Visual Studio 2022 MSVC 19.30 or newer |
| Windows SDK | A Visual Studio-installed Windows SDK |
| CMake | 3.23 or newer |
| C++ language level | C++20 |
| Configurations | Debug and Release |

Other generators, compilers, architectures, and configurations are currently
unsupported.

Install Visual Studio 2022 with the **Desktop development with C++** workload,
a Windows SDK, and CMake 3.23 or newer. Git for Windows is needed to clone the
repository and initialize its dependencies, but not to compile a complete
source tree.

## Dependencies

The renderer uses [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx), vendored through
`thirdparty/bgfx.cmake` at a tested tag. That submodule contains bgfx, bx, and
bimg as nested submodules, so initialize it recursively:

```powershell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The audio layer uses [miniaudio](https://github.com/mackron/miniaudio),
vendored through `thirdparty/miniaudio` at a tested tag and compiled as one
translation unit from `thirdparty/miniaudio-impl.c`.

For a fresh clone, use `git clone --recurse-submodules`. Configuration stops
with instructions if a submodule is missing. Update a pinned tag in a
separate change.

Compression uses [LZO](https://www.oberhumer.com/opensource/lzo/) 2.10,
vendored under `thirdparty/lzo` and built by `thirdparty/CMakeLists.txt`.
Upstream publishes releases as a tarball rather than through a repository, so
this copy is checked in instead of pinned as a submodule. It holds only the
LZO1X-1 sources the engine calls; take a later release by extracting it over
the files already there, in a separate change.

## Configure and build

Run these commands from the repository root in PowerShell:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A Win32
cmake --build build --config Debug
cmake --build build --config Release
```

CMake normally finds Visual Studio through the Visual Studio Installer. For an
unregistered installation, set `CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE` to its directory and
product version.

The solution contains only Debug and Release. Each writes its runtime files to
`build/bin/<configuration>/` and copies nothing anywhere else. The test harnesses
build into `build/test-bin/<configuration>/`, so `bin/` holds only what the game
runs. Compiler and linker intermediates stay in the selected build directory.

| Configuration | Runtime files |
| --- | --- |
| Debug | `GameD.exe`, `GameD.pdb`, `GameD.map`, `Language.dll` |
| Release | `Game.exe`, `Game.pdb`, `Game.map`, `Language.dll` |

Run a build from its output directory, naming the game data with `-DATADIR=`:

```powershell
build\bin\Debug\GameD.exe -DATADIR=Run
```

`OPENTS_GAME_DIR` names that data directory for the generated Visual Studio
debugger settings and defaults to `Run/`. The data directory is only read from.
Saved games, logs, and crash reports go to the user directory, which defaults to
the executable's own directory, so a build writes beside itself unless
`-USERDIR=` says otherwise.

## Experimental clang-cl cross-build

An unsupported Linux cross-build is available for compiler-portability work. It
uses native `clang-cl`, LLD, and LLVM library and resource tools with the
MSVC headers and libraries. It does not expand the supported build matrix or
establish runtime behavior.

The reconstructed codebase may still contain undefined behavior that the
supported MSVC build happens not to expose. A successful clang-cl build may
therefore run incorrectly or fail at runtime; validate any result separately.

Provide a directory containing a Visual Studio layout and Windows SDK. The
cross-build uses the layout's default MSVC toolset and newest complete SDK.
Configure a single-configuration Ninja build:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/clang-cl -G Ninja \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
  -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchains/clang-cl-msvc.cmake \
  -DOPENTS_MSVC_ROOT=/path/to/msvc
cmake --build build/clang-cl
```

The toolchain requires `clang-cl`, `lld-link`, `llvm-lib`, `llvm-mt`, and
`llvm-rc` on `PATH`. It exports `compile_commands.json`; one configuration in
`.vscode/c_cpp_properties.clang.example.json` reads that file for IntelliSense.

## Experimental x64 build

An unsupported 64-bit build is available for porting work. It does not expand the
supported build matrix or establish runtime behavior.

The configuration has no continuous integration and no entry in the verification
boundary below, so treat a result from it as evidence about the port rather than
about the game.

Configure it with the x64 platform:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build/x64 -G "Visual Studio 17 2022" -A x64
cmake --build build/x64 --config Debug
```

A save records pointer identities at a fixed width, but the members and raw
structures around them still travel at the build's own widths, so a 64-bit
build's saves are not interchangeable with a supported build's. The packed
version stamp that saves and network packets carry is the same for both, so
nothing rejects a save or a peer on that basis. Configuring the build warns
about it.

## Test harnesses on a native toolchain

The test harnesses build with a native compiler, which is how portability work is
checked without a Windows machine. The engine target does not link: most of its
translation units compile, and the rest stop on the Windows headers they name.

```bash
cmake -S . -B build/native -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
tests/check-native.sh build/native
```

There is no option to set. The build configures whatever toolchain it is
handed and each target asks for what it needs, so what is supported is a
statement in this document rather than a gate in CMake. The supported build is
the 32-bit Visual Studio one; configuring anything else warns where it matters
and otherwise proceeds.

Continuous integration runs exactly that on Linux, so a change that breaks the
native harnesses is caught rather than discovered later.

That script builds every harness, holds the ones that fail against
`tests/unported.txt`, and runs the rest. Nothing is skipped, so it fails both
when a harness that used to build stops and when one on the list starts
working; the second is progress and the answer is to delete its line.

Sixteen of the thirty-seven build and pass on macOS and on Linux at the time of
writing. The other twenty-one reach `windows.h`, `io.h`, `comdef.h` or the MSVC
spellings of the C library, most of them through an include and not by their own
subject, as do about a third of the engine's own sources.

The options the engine builds with are MSVC's, and the native build passes the
equivalents rather than the same spellings: `-O0` and `-O2` for `/Od` and `/O2`,
`-ffp-contract=off` for `/fp:precise`, and `-msse2 -mfpmath=sse` for `/arch:SSE2`
where the target is 32-bit x86. `/RTC1` and the static runtime library have no
equivalent and are not replaced.

## Build from Visual Studio Code

With the recommended extensions installed, the repository provides:

- CMake Tools settings;
- a configure task, a configuration picker, and hidden per-configuration tasks
  used by the launch configurations;
- launch and attach configurations;
- Test Explorer integration.

Standard VS Code shortcuts such as `Ctrl+Shift+B`, `F5`, and `Ctrl+F5` work as
usual.

## Build identity

The top-level `CMakeLists.txt` declares the project version in
`project(OpenTS VERSION ...)`. Since `project()` accepts only numbers, any
SemVer prerelease label goes in `OPENTS_VERSION_PRERELEASE`. Both values must
match the development entry in the manual's release registry;
`python manual/tools/manage.py check` verifies this.

Each build writes two generated headers from that version and the repository
state:

| Header | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `opents_version.h` | The version components, the version string, a prerelease flag, and the packed version number |
| `opents_build.h` | The commit, branch, commit date, whether tracked files were modified, and the version as it is displayed |

The packed version stores the major, minor, and patch components in one byte
each. Saves and network peers reject a different number. Builds within one
release cycle, including prereleases, share it, but their saves, replays, and
network sessions may still be incompatible.

The version resources in `Game.exe` and `Language.dll`, the title screen,
version dialog, crash report, and debug log banner all read these headers. A
normal build shows the version and commit, such as `0.1.0 (ab12cd3)`, plus a
marker when tracked files are modified. The commit identifies the build for
diagnostics; it is not a save or network compatibility stamp. An official
build configured with `-DOPENTS_OFFICIAL_BUILD=ON` shows only its declared
version.

`opents_version.h` changes only with the version, so an ordinary commit does not
rebuild code that reads only that header. `opents_build.h` is checked on every
build, so a new commit appears without reconfiguring; an unchanged header is
not rewritten.

A tag or pull-request build uses a detached checkout with no branch. Its stamp
uses a ref that points to the commit, preferring a tag, so a pull-request CI
build names the pull request instead of `HEAD`.

Git is optional at build time once the complete source tree is present. Without
Git or repository metadata, the build records the commit as `unknown` and shows
the version without one.

## Continuous integration

The `Engine` workflow runs for ready pull requests and pushes to `main` when
their changed paths match its engine and build filters. Draft pull requests do
not build until marked ready; the workflow then builds their current commit.

`Engine nightly` runs daily. A scheduled run cancels itself when the newest
commit is at least 25 hours old; manually started runs always build. This keeps
the latest successful scheduled run attached to downloadable artifacts.

Both use the reusable `Engine build` workflow. On a Windows runner with Visual
Studio 2022, it configures and builds Win32 Debug and Release with the commands
above, runs CTest, and uploads each configuration's executable, language
library, symbol file, and license notices. Artifact names contain the
configuration and short commit. Linker maps are omitted because the symbol
files are sufficient.
After a successful pull-request build, `Engine build comment` maintains one
pull-request comment with direct nightly.link downloads.

Publishing a GitHub release runs `Engine release`. It builds the release commit
with `-DOPENTS_OFFICIAL_BUILD=ON`, packages `Game.exe`, `Language.dll`,
`Game.pdb`, and the project and third-party license notices in a zip named
after the release tag, and attaches it to the release. It also appends notes
generated from the manual's change records by
`python manual/tools/manage.py release-notes`. See
[Maintaining](../manual/MAINTAINING.md) for the full release procedure.

CI collects the uploaded artifacts from `build/bin/<configuration>/`.

## Verification boundary

The supported matrix was verified on August 16, 2026 with CMake 4.3.3, Visual
Studio 2022 Community 17.14.37328.6, MSVC 19.44.35228, and Windows SDK
10.0.26100. Fresh Win32 Debug and Release builds completed successfully. The
builds retain inherited MSVC warnings; warnings are not treated as errors, but
contributions should not add new warnings.

This verifies only that the supported toolchain compiles, links, and produces
the listed files. Runtime behavior requires separate play testing.

The repository contains no maps, movies, audio, or other original game assets.
Keep legally obtained runtime data local and outside version control. The
repository safety rules are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
